# Streamlit Application Example (Vegas Guidebook)
---
## Purpose
This repo is one of a collection of repos that I have to exhibit my programming/technical skills. In this repo, I exhibit the following:

1. Ability to design a code to accomplish a workplace tool.
2. Understanding of caching for speed.
3. Understanding of APIs to get data for user requests.
4. Understanding of API keys.
5. Understanding of application layout for UI/UX.
6. Use of ```streamlit``` python package to quickly deploy an MVP/POC application.
7. Use of JSON.

## Code Files
At the time of your cloning the repo, there may be additional JSON or img files that are not incorporated into the application (or have recently been removed). No files, however, will be too large to cause a disturbance when you clone.

## Code Execution
This repo shows the code that is hosted on Streamlit's server space. This code can be run in two different ways:
1. Using streamlit server:

    - click [HERE](https://jamesmichaelballowprojects-vegas-guidebook.streamlit.app/) to see my application running.
    - if you see a message indicating the app is down, then click the button on screen to relaunch it (it just needs to go back into memory on Streamlit's server space)

2. Using your local machine:

    - clone this repo to your local machine.
    - install streamlit with ```pip install streamlit```.
    - using your terminal, navigate to the "vegas_guidebook" folder.
    - run the application using ```streamlit run Landing_Page.py```
